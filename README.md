# Data Visualisation Using Dimple.js
I am using Baseball_Players data for this visualisation

## Summary
I plotted the average number of home runs made by each height group categorised by their handedness. The visualisation shows the performance of each height group, their performace for a particular handed group, and even compare their performance handedness-wise, two or all at a time. Looking at the graph, it is clear that the players with height 76 inches have highest number of home runs on average, followed by those with height 67 inches, with maximum contributions from both-handed and left-handed players respectively.

## Design
I am using a bar chart for this visualisation as it makes comparison very intuitive. Earlier I was using scatter plot, which gave the feel of a continuous x-axis(height) and made it difficult to make comparison through heights of players.

## Feedback
1. One person recommended me to make the graph comparative. Initially I was showing different categories of "handedness", one per view, and their was no way to compare their performance through a single view.
2. One reviewer told me that he thought that the heights(x-axis) suggested continuation, but on closer look looked categorised. This was due to the fact that I was using scatter plot instead of bar chart.
3. Some other person told me that the viewer should have the option to pause the animation. Earlier I was animating the graph from the beginning with no option to pause it.
